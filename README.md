# To-do List Exercise

This page is responsible for keeping track of a list of items. You can add, edit and delete items as you wish. You can also mark as done or unmark them and the item format will be changed. The site uses IndexedDB as a database to store the items that have been uploaded with all the changes. The application is mainly done using JavaScript code.

The form validates that all fields have been completed.

Now you can organize your items into categories! They can be hidden or shown in case of many items to make the application easier to use.
